      <p>Jupiter is the largest planet in our solar system, and it has some very interesting worlds in orbit. The four largest moons of Jupiter
        are called the Galilean moons because they were discovered by Galileo. </p>
        <p>These four moons are <a href=#Io>Io</a>, <a href=#Europa>Europa</a>, <a href=#Ganymede>Ganymede</a>, and <a href=#Callisto>Callisto</a>.</p>

    <section id="Io">
      <h3>Io</h3>
      <h5>Stats:</h5>
      <ul>
        <!-- bullet points -->
        <li><strong>Diameter:</strong> 2,263.8 miles</li>
        <li><strong>Surface Gravity:</strong>1.796 m/s^2</li>
        <li><strong>Orbital Period:</strong> 42 hours</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Io is the closest Gallilean moon to Jupiter. It's interior is intensely squeezed by the gravity of Jupiter as well as its fellow Galilean moons,
        which causes Io to be covered in volcanoes. In fact, it is the most volanic world in the solar system. It is constantly resurfacing from the lava
        so there are pretty much no visible impact craters on its surface.</p>

    <section id="Europa">
      <h3>Europa</h3>
      <h5>Stats:</h5>
      <ul>
        <!-- bullet points -->
        <li><strong>Diameter:</strong> 1,939.7 miles</li>
        <li><strong>Surface Gravity:</strong>1.315 m/s^2</li>
        <li><strong>Orbital Period:</strong> 85 hours</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Europa is the second closest Galilean moon to Jupiter. Its interior is also squeezed by Jupiter and its fellow Galilean moons, but not as intensely as Io.
        Europa is made primarily of water ice, and below its icy surface lies a large, global liquid water ocean. This is the most likely place in the solar solar solarsystem
        besides Earth to harbor life. Its surface is covered in cracks in the ice that get filled in by water from the global underground ocean.

    <section id="Ganymede">
      <h3>Ganymede</h3>
      <h5>Stats:</h5>
      <ul>
        <!-- bullet points -->
        <li><strong>Diameter:</strong> 3,273.5 miles</li>
        <li><strong>Surface Gravity:</strong>1.428 m/s^2</li>
        <li><strong>Orbital Period:</strong> 172 hours</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Ganymede is the third closest Galilean moon to Jupiter. Its intereior is tugged but not as strongly as Io and Europa. Ganymede is colder and icier than Europa,
        but it possible has a liquid water subsurface ocean as well. It has some of the cracks that Europa has which are caused by water from the subsurface ocean filling the cracks
        and freezing, but it also has many impact craters. Ganymede is the largest moon in the solar system -- even larger than Mercury! If it were not orbiting Jupiter, it would be a planet.

    <section id="Callisto">
      <h3>Callisto</h3>
      <h5>Stats:</h5>
      <ul>
        <!-- bullet points -->
        <li><strong>Diameter:</strong> 2,995.4 miles</li>
        <li><strong>Surface Gravity:</strong>1.236 m/s^2</li>
        <li><strong>Orbital Period:</strong> 17 days</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Callisto is the farthest Galilean moon from Jupiter. Unlike the other Galilean moons, Callisto's interior is not significantly squeezed, so it does not get significantly heated internally.
        This means that there is no subsurface ocean or molten rock, and there is no resurfacing. This results in a heavily cratered surface. Callisto is the coldest of the Galilean moons.
